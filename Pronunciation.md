# How is "mmajs" pronounced?

"mages" (preliminary), unless people decide on something else or find a better name.

## Explanation

The name "mmajs" is the intersection of a number of coincidences and can be pronounced many ways.

Some plausible pronunciations are:

- majis
- matches
- mashes
- maths
- mass
- maize
- mice

(The latter possibilities exist since "j" is the "y" or "h" sound in other languages, which goes silent since it's hard to pronounce. In general, {m} + {æ, eɪ, aɪ} + {ʤɪ, ʧɪ, ʃɪ}? + {s, z})

Some still plausible pronunciations if you are me are:

- matrix
- maʃɪs (sounds satisfying)

The pure etymology of this word is "mmj2" (the proof assistant) + "ijs" (dutch for ice cream;
always wanted to use it someday because of the "js" coincidence), and then avoiding "ijs" by using "a"
(this tool is for everyone, not just me).

However, "majis" (/mæʤɪs/ as in "magistry") is probably what someone would guess with no other context, so
"mages" is probably the best option (as "matches" and "maths" may be confusing).

Another delightful coincidence is that "mmajs" backwards is kinda like "strawberry jam".

This is indeed Rust indeed of Javascript, but "rs" and "js" are "almost" isomorphic under symmetry.

I tried to tokiponize this. The second syllable either has t, s, or j(!) ɪ is halfway between e and i. So: Mati, Mate, Masi, Mase, Maje

∃ eɪ. I guess the first vowel could be e. Interestingly, none of these options seem to collide with any word.

∃ (!)
- mayjays (blessed)
- may j s (cursed)
- mʌ jess

A few more options because "js" is just that ambiguous
