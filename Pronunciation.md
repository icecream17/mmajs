# How is "mmajs" pronounced?

"mages" (preliminary), unless people decide on something else or find a better name.

## Explanation

The name "mmajs" is the intersection of a number of coincidences and can be pronounced many ways.

Some plausible pronunciations are:

- majis
- matches
- mashes
- maths
- mass
- mages
- maize
- mice

(The latter possibilities exist since "j" is the "y" or "h" sound in other languages)

The pure etymology of this word is "mmj2" (the proof assistant) + "ijs" (dutch for ice cream;
always wanted to use it someday because of the "js" coincidence), and then avoiding "ijs" by using "a"
(this tool is for everyone, not just me).

However, "majis" (as in "magistry") is probably what someone would guess with no other context, so
"mages" is probably the best option (as "matches" and "maths" may be confusing).

Another delightful coincidence is that "mmajs" backwards is kinda like "strawberry jam"
